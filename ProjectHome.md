# About #

Google Chrome extension that lets you quickly find any location on the map.

In short, the Geocoding extension helps you quickly find the latitude, longitude and the WOEID (Where on Earth IDentifier) for a given address.

Technically speaking, Geocoding adds a red button in the browser's toolbar that, when clicked, will opens a pop-up window with three text fields, labeled as following: Street, Zip Code and City.

Based on your input, the Geocoding add-on will return a location and the address coordinates by using Google Maps.
